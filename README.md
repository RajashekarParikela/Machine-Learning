# Machine-Learning

This project demonstrates how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) learn and extract features from image data using the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The goal is to visualize what happens inside a CNN.


Objectives

- Train a simple CNN on the Fashion-MNIST dataset
- Extract and visualize intermediate **feature maps**
- Understand how features evolve from low-level (edges) to high-level (object parts)
